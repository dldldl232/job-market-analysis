Senior Associate, Data Scientist - Compliance & Ethics Analytics & Innovation

Data is at the center of everything we do. As a startup, we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.

As a Data Scientist at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in computing and machine learning technologies and operating across billions of customer records to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time and agony in their financial lives.

Team Description

On the Compliance Analytics & Innovation team you’ll be on the cutting edge of transforming Capital One’s approach to risk management. With the help of talented partners across Product, Tech, Risk, and the Lines of Business, you’ll be building out new Machine Learning and AI models in order to strengthen our Compliance and AML program. This role is focused on supporting and developing our List Screening models, and expanding our approach to innovation to other key areas within Compliance & Ethics. The ideal candidate will have experience managing complex projects to the highest levels of quality, with the ability to communicate the vision to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. You should have an understanding of python, SQL, standard machine learning and modeling techniques, and an interest in generative AI. We are looking for someone with a strong sense of curiosity, who does not settle for the status quo. Your work will have concrete impacts on the Compliance organization, with visibility and exposure to senior leadership, auditors, and regulators.

Role Description

In this role, you will:
• Partner with a cross-functional team of data scientists, software engineers, and product managers to deliver a product customers love
• Leverage a broad stack of technologies — Python, Conda, AWS, H2O, Spark, and more — to reveal the insights hidden within huge volumes of numeric and textual data
• Build machine learning models through all phases of development, from design through training, evaluation, validation, and implementation
• Flex your interpersonal skills to translate the complexity of your work into tangible business goals

The Ideal Candidate is:
• Innovative. You continually research and evaluate emerging technologies. You stay current on published state-of-the-art methods, technologies, and applications and seek out opportunities to apply them.
• Creative. You thrive on bringing definition to big, undefined problems. You love asking questions and pushing hard to find answers. You’re not afraid to share a new idea.
• Technical. You’re comfortable with open-source languages and are passionate about developing further. You have hands-on experience developing data science solutions using open-source tools and cloud computing platforms.
• Statistically-minded. You’ve built models, validated them, and backtested them. You know how to interpret a confusion matrix or a ROC curve. You have experience with clustering, classification, sentiment analysis, time series, and deep learning.
• A data guru. “Big data” doesn’t faze you. You have the skills to retrieve, combine, and analyze data from a variety of sources and structures. You know understanding the data is often the key to great data science.

Basic Qualifications:
• Currently has, or is in the process of obtaining one of the following with an expectation that the required degree will be obtained on or before the scheduled start date:

• Statistically-minded. You’ve built models, validated them, and backtested them. You know how to interpret a confusion matrix or a ROC curve. You have experience with clustering, classification, sentiment analysis, time series, and deep learning.
